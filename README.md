# vis4dh-keywords
Compation materials for the paper "A Data-Driven Introduction to the State-of-the-art in Visualization for the Digital Humanities" (Soon to be published).

Hello, in order to replicate my paper you need to get your hands on the VIS4DH dataset I curated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCnEIfbyow7s7_qnl_KZs4cUZjrt4bpz5C8VJLe-XIA/edit?usp=sharing)
Just add the dataset, make the Jupyter notebook use it and voil√°. It will take you to the different tecniques I applied using mainly sklearn, nltk, bokeh and networkx. 

In end, you will generate a beautiful strategic diagram and associated keyword netowrk to explore. 
Anything, just send an email or open a GH issue / PR. 
Hope you find all this as much interesting as I do!
